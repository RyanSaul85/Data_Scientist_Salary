# Data Scientist Salaries Depending On Company Variables

##### When you are looking to begin working a new job, change industry or are looking to be promoted, it seemsextremely important to find the market compensation. I chose to do a project on determing specific company factors that influence how much a data scientist gets paid. Some of the feature variables include industry, location, profitability, years establshed and size. For this project, I used feature engineering to determine the most prominent factors in deciding data scientistâ€™s salaries. I then generated analytical and visual results to show data scientist salary differences based on the dataset variables.

### The Process
##### About The Data
* from 2021
* Compiled from Glassdoor

##### Loading Libraries And Data
* raw data from kaggle via Glassdoor
* dataframe created from csv file

##### Data Cleaning
* Make sure format of data is correct (int, float, object)
* Only include salaries with the job title including 'data scientist'
* Adjust the 'Size' column to just one value
* Create groups for 'Rating' and 'Location'

##### Data Visualization
I generate graphs and charts to help visualize the following
* Most popular job title
* Which companies are hiring the most data scientists
* What are the top fields using data scientists
* which industry has the highest need
* The effects of company revenue, rating, location, age, size and profitability

#### Tech:  Python, Pandas, Numpy, SciPy, Matplotlib
